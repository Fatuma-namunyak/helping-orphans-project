      <h2>Helping the orphans</h2>
      <p>
        Lack of food,clothes i have come across many orphans sleeping in streets
        they don't have food clothing is also a problem you find them wearing
        toned clothes borrowinng food thi is so sad. So i have come up with a
        solution of building a place for orphans whereby they will no longer
        have this problems they will live a happy and comfortable life like
        other children. With the help of people we can also change the life of
        this children we can also take them to school so that they can acquire
        knowledge like other children and also to make them feel loved.

         Life as such is challenging and the humans have made it
          more complicated because life has fallen into class and 
          categories where the rich are getting richer and the poor are dying for food.
           it is heart-wrenching to see this situation because people are suffering 
           from hunger, lack of education and also some are homeless. Seeing them in this situation is really hurting.

        This children are really suffering they are helpless even a cup they
        don't have the use their hands to drink water with the help of people we
        can change their life. So come up with this idea because i felt pitty to 
        this children is not good that they have to suffer just because they are orphans.
        I will build an orphanage whereby they will eat, sleep and be educated.
