      <h2>Helping the orphans</h2>
      <p>
        Lack of food,clothes i have come across many orphans sleeping in streets
        they don't have food clothing is also a problem you find them wearing
        toned clothes borrowinng food thi is so sad. So i have come up with a
        solution of building a place for orphans whereby they will no longer
        have this problems they will live a happy and comfortable life like
        other children. With the help of people we can also change the life of
        this children we can also take them to school so that they can acquire
        knowledge like other children and also to make them feel loved
